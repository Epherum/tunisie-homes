# Resume highlights (use after launch)

- Built an end-to-end Tunisian real estate pipeline: Python scrapers, normalization, optional AI embeddings, and Supabase storage powering a Next.js web app.
- Delivered a live listings experience in Next.js with ISR and Supabase; added animated cards, feature chips, and image fallbacks for smooth UX on slow feeds.
- Implemented resilient scraping for tunisie-annonce.com with polite delays, encoding fixes, and data quality checks before upserts.
- Added optional image downloading/uploading flows plus map-ready location fields for future geocoding or Mapbox display.
- Enabled AI-ready data by generating embeddings (Gemini/OpenAI) and storing them alongside properties for semantic search or recommendations.
- Coordinated schema upgrades and storage plans (see `docs/`), keeping app and data factory in sync through Prisma and Supabase updates.

Optional closing line to quantify impact:
- "Result: surfaced X fresh listings/week with Y% error reduction, supporting Z users or partners."
